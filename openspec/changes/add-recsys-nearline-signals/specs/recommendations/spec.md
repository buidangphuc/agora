## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Nearline real-time session signals

The system SHALL maintain real-time user session signals and recent interactions in Redis updated within seconds of tracking event receipt.

#### Scenario: User recent views update nearline signals

- **WHEN** a user views item `item-A` and then `item-B`
- **THEN** the nearline signal layer records `[item-B, item-A]` in the user's recent items list in Redis and increments the respective category affinities

#### Scenario: Real-time item co-occurrence is tracked

- **WHEN** multiple users view `item-A` and `item-B` within the same session
- **THEN** the co-view count between `item-A` and `item-B` is incremented in Redis
